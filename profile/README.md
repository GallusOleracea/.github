### Our Vision
These days, the world is in tumult and frankly, Gallus Oleracea is not happy with it. Therefore, we want to create quality products and programs that everyone enjoys, by improving our products little by little based on customer advice. Well, at least 0% of the customer advice we receive, and we improve by at least -100%. We're doing slightly better than Apple in that we don't turn cheese graters into PCs, but we expect you to run all of our services on a PC that is either cheese-greater shaped or Kraft Mac N Cheese shaped. Our vision is for a better future where technology is readily available to everyone and anyone - and that includes you. Try out any of our services now for free for about 0.1s and then choose one of our "ultra-cheap" "really-good-value" plans starting from Â£581349.99 for 1GB of space (we're still doing better than most cloud storage services out there. Inflation. We blame it on inflation. Or just use Windows 7.)
