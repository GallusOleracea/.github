### Our Vision
These days, the world is in tumult and frankly, Gallus Oleracea is not happy with it. Therefore, we want to create quality products and programs that everyone enjoys, by improving our products little by little based on customer advice. Well, at least 0% of the customer advice we receive, and we improve by at least -100%. We're doing slightly better than Apple in that we don't turn cheese graters into PCs, but we expect you to run all of our services on a PC that is either cheese-greater shaped or Kraft Mac N Cheese shaped. Our vision is for a better future where technology is readily available to everyone and anyone - and that includes you. Try out any of our services now for free for about 0.1s and then choose one of our "ultra-cheap" "really-good-value" plans starting from £581349.99 for 1GB of space (we're still doing better than most cloud storage services out there. Inflation. We blame it on inflation. Or just use Windows 7.)

### Current ~Projects~ Products
Of course, merely talking about what we plan to do will never achieve anything (just like our HR and marketing departments!). Instead, we strive to revolutionize CS, maximising impact to redefine the game and push the boundaries of what is possible for computational heresy. Therefore, we are actively working on our projects to make the world of computers a better place, free of the ghastly AI slop we can see everywhere. Indeed, some might say our projects lack any intelligence at all (artificial or otherwise). Our experienced developers are currently working on the following projects:

- Gallus Oleracea® molestus™ - A programming language designed to fix the inherent issues with programming itself. **Coming Jan. 2026**.

**Pre-order now for just $2999.99**
